# Introduction

This is a helper plugin that saves lua variables across sessions.

Currently, I am just using this to save my last theme,
remember the last file I editted, and so on.

Limitations:
- I limited data storing to key and value only.
- This is not a secure solution to saving any sensitive information.

Example:
key1,value1
key2,value2
